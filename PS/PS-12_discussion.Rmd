## Question 1

American Airlines is concerned with the temperature and humidity recorded for
its daily flight AA 59 from JFK to San Francisco, CA. In particular they want to 
study the relationship between temperature and humidity with humidity as the $y$
variable. 

1. Create an appropriate visualization for this data.
1. Fit a linear regression and interpret
    a) The estimate of the slope
    a) The 95% confidence interval for the slope
    a) The conclusion of the hypothesis test using non-statisticial language
1. Visualize the *residuals* and comment on their distribution

## Discussion

Recall from Midterm II Question 2.d), that to join `flights` and `weather`, we have
to join by `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, and `origin`:

<img src="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/relational-nycflights.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 400px;"/>

```{r, warning=FALSE}
flights_with_weather <- flights %>%
  filter(carrier == "AA" & flight == 59) %>% 
  left_join(weather, by=c("year","month","day","hour","origin"))

ggplot(flights_with_weather, aes(x=temp, y=humid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)
```

It appears there is a positive relationship.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Fit regression
model <- lm(humid~temp, data=flights_with_weather)

# Inspect regression output table
model_table <- model %>% 
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE)
model_table %>% 
  kable(digits=3)
```

1. The slope is estimated to be 0.506. Meaning for every increase of 1 degree F
in temp, there is an average associated increase of 1% in humidity. Makes sense,
heat and humidity go together!
1. The 95% confidence interval for the true slope $\beta_1$ is (0.411, 0.601).
Based on our CI procedure that's 95% reliable, here is our estimated plausible
range of values. Note that 0 is not included, suggestive of a significant
positive relationship!
1. The p-value is 0, so we reject $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$ with near certainty!

Looking at the residuals AKA **lack-of-fit**, they appear centered at 0 and
roughly normally distributed. Thus our above confidence intervals and p-values
have valid interpretation!

```{r, warning=FALSE}
mode_points <- model %>% 
  augment()
ggplot(mode_points, aes(x=.resid)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=0, linetype="dashed")
```
