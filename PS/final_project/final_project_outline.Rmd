## Learning Goals

**Only one**: The first course objective in the syllabus: *Have students engage in the
data/science research pipeline in as faithful a manner as possible while
maintaining a level suitable for novices*:

<img src="../../assets/figure/pipeline.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px;" border="10"/>


#### Format

* Your final project will center around writing a "data journalism" style 
newspaper article suitable for publication in <a href =
"https://middleburycampus.com/" target = "_blank">The Middlebury Campus
newspaper</a>. In other words, your target audience is the Middlebury community.
Examples of such types of journalism can be found on:
    + <a href = "http://fivethirtyeight.com/" target = "_blank">FiveThirtyEight</a>
    + The New York Times' <a href = "http://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot" target = "_blank">The Upshot</a>
* You must flex your "data science" muscles you've built this semester. In
particular, data visualization and wrangling.



## Past Examples

From Fall 2016. In the spirit of <a target="_blank" class="page-link"

```{r, echo=FALSE}
read_csv("2016-09_final_projects.csv") %>% 
  select(-Folder) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```





## Important Dates

1. **By Fri Apr 28 - Project Proposal**: Project proposal (see below) in both
printed and electronic format and an electronic submission of:
    + All data files
    + An `.R` script that loads the data so you can `View()` them.
1. **By Fri May 5 - Feedback Session**: To make sure your project idea is
feasible, after you've submitted your proposal, your group must schedule to
speak to me during office hours so that I can give feedback. While this must be
done by Fri May 5, please note the earlier you complete this, the more breathing
room this will give you.
1. **By Tue May 23 at 12pm - Electronic-Only Final Project Submission**. 
<!--
    + In the RStudio Server group shared folder:
        + A `final_project.Rmd` file that completely reproduces your analysis i.e. I should have to press Knit only once to recreate the entire HTML page.
        + All necessary data files.
    + Individually: A Google Forms survey, which I will email on Fri Dec 16 by 5pm.
    + Your project won't be considered submitted until I give you email confirmation that everything looks good.
* **Honor Code**: This is the equivalent of an academic term paper; all honor code rules about plagarism and citations apply.
* **Submission Format**: Each group must create a single RStudio Server shared 
project that is shared amongst the group members and with me (please email the
URL to me). All your work will be centrally located here; do not email me any
files.

## 1. Project Proposal

#### Data Sets

* Your **immediate goal** should be to get some data loaded into RStudio. This 
may take some help from me as finding the right data sets is very important, as
they need to balance:
    + Being complex enough to use the data science toolbox developed this semester.
    + Being rich enough to be able to answer meaningful scientific questions with.
    + Not being so complex and rich that you are overwhelmed, as you are only novices.
* Having two or more different data sets to join is not an explicit requirement
for this project; your scientific question will dictate this need.
* Suggested Sources: 
    + Whatever you're interested in!
    + Make an appointment with the Middlebury Data Services Librarian Ryan Clement at <a target="_blank" class="page-link" href="http://guides.middlebury.edu/prf.php?account_id=75445">`go/ryan/`</a>
    + Kaggle.com is a machine learning/prediction website. See their <a target="_blank" class="page-link" href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">data set list</a>.
    + `data.world` is a new <a target="_blank" class="page-link" href="https://data.world/">repository of data</a> from various disciplines.
    + The `fivethirtyeight` R package.  See <a target="_blank" class="page-link" href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight/master/vignettes/fivethirtyeight.html#data-sets">data set list</a>. Not all data sets in this package are allowable, so be sure to consult with me as soon as you can.

    

#### Write-Up

Your group proposal (to be submitted in print and electronically on Slack) should contain the following:

1. **Title**: The title of your project.
1. **Group Members**: List of all group members.
1. **Purpose**: Describe the general topic/phenomenon you want to explore:
    + Why should a Middlebury student be interested in your work? 
    + What do you hope people will learn from your project?
1. **Scientific Question**: Journalism, just like academic writing, has the goal
of answering questions, but with a slightly more informal tone. Andrew Flowers
of 538 referred to it as "social science on demand." What is the scientific question you
want to answer using data?
1. **Data Sources**: Describe where you will find/access your
data. Be as specific as you can, listing URLs and file formats if possible.
1. **Data Format**: Describe what your data set looks like:
    * How many tables will you have? What are the observational units of each table?
    * How many rows does each table have?
    * How many columns does each table have and what are their names i.e. the
    variables? What are their units?




## 2. Feedback Session

All done!




## 3. Final Project Submission

Electronic-Only Final Project Submission:

* Due Tuesday 5/23 at 12pm on group Slack Direct Message:
    1. As a group via Slack direct message to group and me:
        a) A <a href="https://rudeboybert.github.io/MATH116/PS/final_project/Final_Project.Rmd" target="_blank">`Final_Project.Rmd`</a> file that completely reproduces your analysis i.e. I should have to press Knit only once to recreate the entire HTML page.
        a) All necessary data files.
        a) An <a href="http://rpubs.com/" target="_blank">Rpubs.com</a> link of your R Markdown HTML document published on the web.
    1. Individually:
        a) A Google Forms survey, which I will post on Slack under `#announcements` on Monday 5/22 at 11am
* **Important**: Your project wonâ€™t be considered submitted until
    1. All the above components are submitted
    1. I give you confirmation on Slack that everything looks good.
* **Honor Code**: This is the equivalent of an academic term paper; all honor code rules about plagarism and citations apply.













<!--
## Electronic-Only Final Project Submission

Roughly speaking, your final project submission will have two major components:

* The actual journalism article. As to knowing the guidelines (length, format,
tone), just ask yourself: "What does a newspaper/online news story sound like?"
* A supplementary materials section that goes more in depth about the
nitty-gritty details, that one might want to spare casual readers from, but
include for people wanting to learn more.
* I will post the template `final_project.Rmd` file in the Problem Sets section
of the course webpage by Monday Nov 14th.
