### Announcements

* In-class exercises will now largely center around chapters of the textbook [An
Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences](https://rudeboybert.github.io/IntroStatDataSciences/) by Kim and
Ismay. I encourage you to work together, as collaborative learning is many times more effective than learning in isolation.
* If you weren't able to complete the in-class exercises during class time,
please do so on your own before the next lecture.
* In particular, do the "Learning Checks" indicated by the green boxes. We will
revisit them the following lecture.
