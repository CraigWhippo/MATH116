### Announcements

* I will post a Learning Check discussion under "After-Class Updates" before the next lecture.  
For example, the discussion for the Learning Checks from Lec04 are posted on that page.
* Refresher: What is tidy data?
  1. Each variable forms a column.
  2. Each observation forms a row.
  3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

* Learning Check 1: For each of the 5NG examples in the above slides, following the example of Napoleon's march and the Grammar of Graphics
    1. identify the `data` variables being displayed and what type of variable they are
    1. identify the `aes()`thetic attribute of the `geom_`etric object the above `data` variables are being mapped to
* Learning Check 2: Answer the following questions:
    1. Scatterplot: Does spending more on a movie yield higher IMDB ratings?
    1. Linegraph: Why are there drops in the number of flights?
    1. Boxplot: Click <a target="_blank" class="page-link" href="http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/anatomy/box_plot.png">here</a> for an explanation of boxplots. About what proportion of manual car models sold between 1984 and 2015 got 20 mpg or worse mileage?
    1. Barplot: About how many babies were named "Hayden" between 1990-2014?
    1. Histogram: What are the smallest and largest visible heights and what do you think of them? Also, think of one graph improvement to better convey information about SF OkCupid users.
