### Thought Experiment

Sample 3 students at random and get their (sample) mean age. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/rudeboybert/e34adae51cc7085efb8b6b7f81d509b1.js"></script>


**Results**: Based on `set.seed(41)`, Luisangel's favorite number.

* **Question**: Why do the sample means below vary?
* **Answer**: Because of the *sampling variability* induced by the *random* sampling!


|Random Sample            | (Sample) Mean Age|
|:------------------------|-----------------:|
|Jack, Jared, Sam         |              21.7|
|Wengel, Rebecca, Steven  |              19.4|
|Stefan, Joccelyn, Sierra |              20.0|
