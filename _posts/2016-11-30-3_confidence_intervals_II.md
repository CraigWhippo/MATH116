### Announcements





### Recall

* **Thought Experiment**: Sample 3 students at random and get their (sample) mean age. Do this ~~many, many, many~~ only 3 times
* **Question**: Why do the sample means below vary?
* **Answer**: Because of the sampling variability induced by the random sampling!


|Random Sample            | (Sample) Mean Age|
|:------------------------|-----------------:|
|Jack, Jared, Sam         |              21.7|
|Wengel, Rebecca, Steven  |              19.4|
