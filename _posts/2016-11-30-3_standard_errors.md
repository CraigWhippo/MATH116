### Recall

* **Thought Experiment**: Sample 3 students at random and get their (sample) mean age. Do this ~~many, many, many~~ only 3 times
* **Question 1**: Why do the sample means below vary?
* **Answer 1**: Because of the sampling variability induced by the random sampling!
* **Question 2**: What value quantifies how much these sample means vary by?
* **Answer 2**: The Standard Error!

|Random Sample            | (Sample) Mean Age|
|:------------------------|-----------------:|
|Jack, Jared, Sam         |              21.7|
|Wengel, Rebecca, Steven  |              19.4|
|Stefan, Joccelyn, Sierra |              20.0|

**Learning checks**: Based on

* the example in the Lec27-B <a href = "{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/LC/confidence_intervals.html" target = "_blank">learning check discussion</a>
* the chalk talk notes from Lec28

1. Explicity compute the **standard error** when taking samples of size `n=5` and `n=50`. 
2. Discuss with your peers **why** they matter in any study that involves some kind of sampling.



### After-Class Updates
