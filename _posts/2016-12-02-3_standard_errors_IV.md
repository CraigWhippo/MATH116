* Learning check:
    + Let's **pretend** we don't know the true mean $\mu = 68.3$ inches
    + Using the `resample()` function, take a **single sample** of size $n=50$ of 50 OkCupid users' heights. Do not `set.seed(76)`
    + Using the `mean()`, `sd()`, and `sqrt()` functions, compute one confidence interval for $\mu$
    + Everyone pod will report their CI's at the end of class.
