## Two Ways to Save R Commands

You can save all commands in either a

* `.R` file, called a *script* file
* `.Rmd` file, called an *R Markdown* file

The former bare-bones, the latter is more powerful.









## What are R Packages?

* **Base R**, i.e. R straight out of the box, is fairly limited in power and functionality.
* **R Packages** are extensions to R contributed by a world-wide community of R users that
extend base R's functionality and are downloadable over the internet from RStudio.



## Installing/Loading Packages

Today we are going to install 3 packages:

* `dplyr`: a package for data manipulation
* `ggplot2`: a package for data visualization
* `babynames`: a package of baby name data

Go to Files Panel -> Packages -> Install -> Type in `dplyr ggplot2 babynames` to install all 3 at once.



## Installing/Loading Packages

* You only need to install packages once, but its a good idea to periodically
update your package by clicking "Update"
* However, each time you use a package you need to **load** it first by typing
`library(PACKAGENAME)` each time you start R










## babynames Package

The [`babynames`](https://github.com/hadley/babynames) package contains for each
year from 1880 to 2013, the number of children born of each sex given each name
in the United States (source: SSA).

Note:

* All names with more than 5 uses are given
* If a name occured less than 5 times in a given year for a given sex, it is
lumped into `"Other"`
