```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```





## 3.1

#### Learning Check

Consider the following data of the price of three stocks (with names `x`, `y`, `z`) 
over 5 days. This data is not in tidy data format. How would you re-format it so that it is?

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
stocks <- data.frame(
  date = as.Date('2009-01-01') + 0:4,
  x = round(rnorm(5, 0, 1), 3),
  y = round(rnorm(5, 0, 2), 3),
  z = round(rnorm(5, 0, 4), 3)
)
knitr::kable(stocks)
```

#### Solution

We want

* Each row to represent one value, in this case one stock price
* Each column to represent one variable of information. In our case, we have three: date, price, and the **name of the stock**

"Tidy data" format is also known as **long format**, unlike the original data which was in **wide format**.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
stocks %>% 
  gather(stock_name, price, -date) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```





## 3.2

#### Learning Check

What among the following choices does any *ONE* row in this `flights` dataset refer to? 

* A. Data on an airline 
* B. Data on a flight
* C. Data on an airport
* D. Data on multiple flights


#### Solution

Run the following in your console to `View()` the `flights` data set again:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(nycflights13)
data(flights)
View(flights)
```

Each row represents data on one **flight**.





## 3.3-3.7

#### Learning Check

* How many different columns are in this dataset?
* How many different rows are in this dataset?
* What are some other examples in this dataset of **numerical** variables? 
* What are some other examples in this dataset of **categorical** variables? 
What makes them different than **quantitative** variables?
* What do you think `int`, `dbl`, `chr`, and `dttm` mean in the output above?

#### Solution

This is where the `glimpse()` function within the `dplyr` pacage for data
manipulation is handy. Remember, to use this function you need to load the
`dplyr` package first.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
glimpse(flights)
```

* There are `r ncol(flights)` columns (i.e. variables) and `r nrow(flights)`
rows (i.e. observations, which in this case are individual flights).
* Numerical variables include: any variables of type
    + `<int>`: integer AKA whole numbers like 1, 2, 3. Used for **counting discrete** quantities. Ex: `year`, `day`, etc.
    + `<dbl>`: double AKA decimal numbers like 1.0, 2.0, 3.1. Used for
    **measuring continuous** quantities, like height, weight, time. Other
    programming languages refer to this as "floats". Ex: `air_time`,
    `dep_delay`.
* Categorial variables include (in this case) any variables of type `<chr>`:
character AKA text data. Ex: `carrier`, `tailnum`,  and `dest`. Categorical
variables separate groups i.e. categories.
* `<dttm>` is a special kind of "date/time" variable. We won't go in depth with these in this class, but leave it to a more advanced class.

**Note** This dataset is sloppily coded:

1. `flight` is coded as `<int>`, but it is **not a numerical variable but rather
a categorial variable where the labels are numbers**. Ex: a flight numbered
"400" is not "twice as much" as a flight numbered "200".
1. Some of the time-related variables are coded as `<int>` and others as `<dbl>`. R treats them the
same when doing math, so its not a big deal, but to be thorough, we should treat anything
time related as `<dbl>` i.e. you measure time, not count time.





## 3.8-3.9

#### Learning Check

* For each of the datasets `weather`, `planes`, `airports`, and `airlines`, load
them using the `data()` function and then `View()` them. Identify what the
observational unit is.
* Say you wanted to see if weather patterns are associated with delays. Sketch
out how would you use the `flights` and `weather` data frames to test this?



#### Solution

Let's pull up spreadsheets for all the data sets. Run the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data(weather)
View(weather)
data(planes)
View(planes)
data(airports)
View(airports)
data(airlines)
View(airlines)
```

The observational units are:

* `weather`: year/month/day/hour **for one of the three NYC airports**
* `planes`: a physical aircraft
* `airports`: an airport
* `airlines`: a carrier

If you want to see which weather patterns are associated with delays, you need to **join** (AKA **merge**) the `flights` data set with the `weather` data set.
We leave specifics until later, but for now, we need to **key** the join by the following variables to match the two data sets:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(flights)
View(weather)
```


* In `flights`: `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `origin`
* In `weather`: `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `origin`
