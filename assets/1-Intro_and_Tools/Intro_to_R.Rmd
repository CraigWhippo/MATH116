## First Thing to Know about Computers

Computers are dumb! You need to:

* Tell it **exactly** and **everything** it needs to do
* Everything needs to be perfect:
    + Parentheses need to match
    + There is no spell check!
    + You need to create everything from scratch
    + Names of objects need to typed exactly
    
    
## Today

* We are **introducing** some of the basics and concepts of programming in R.
* A nice side benefit is many of the concepts translate to almost all programming languages: python, javascript, etc.
* Do not expect a complete understanding today nor do you need to memorize
anything.
* The best way is to learn is to learn by doing, which we'll slowly be
doing as the semester progresses.
    
    


## Tomorrow's Lab

* No problem set yet, so no opportunity for group work, so tomorrow is optional.
* However
    + You can continue tomorrow's exercises
    + I will be there to help people get accustomed to the workflow this class will follow
* If you are feeling overwhelmed, please seek help from your peers or me
**sooner than later**.
    
    


## Remember

**Horror vacui**: Nature abhors a vacuum.

* If we are going to remove this:

* We need to fill the void with a little of this:
