## Load Packages & Data

Run the block of code below only once. Notes:

* Hashtags in R are comment lines that are ignored by the console. This is a
great way to document your code
    + For others, but more importantly
    + Future you! Hadley Wickham quote: "In every project you have at least one other collaborator; future-you. You donâ€™t want future-you to curse past-you"
* You do not need to completely understand the code below for now; we'll be
learning these packages in the upcoming weeks.
* In case you are curious however, after loading the packages, we need to adjust
for the fact that names that occurred less than 5 times for any sex for any
given year were excluded from the data set. We create a new category `Other` to
reflect this.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(babynames)

# Compute counts/proporations for "Other" names
other <- babynames %>% 
  group_by(year, sex) %>% 
  summarise(sum_n=sum(n), sum_prop=sum(prop)) %>% 
  mutate(
    total = sum_n/sum_prop,
    name = "Other",
    prop = 1-sum_prop,
    n = prop * total
    ) %>% 
  select(year, sex, name, n, prop)

# Add "Other" names to babynames
babynames <- babynames %>% 
  bind_rows(other) %>% 
  arrange(year, sex, desc(n))
```




## Explore Data Set

Play around with the `babynames` dataset in the RStudio viewer by running the 
following in the console.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(babynames)
```

In particular, click on the **Filter** button and click in the white boxes under
the variable names and

* Play with any sliders for numerical variables: year, n, prop
* Enter in values to view subsets of rows: sex, name



## Name Trends

The code below shows the popularity trend for the name "Jeffrey" amongst males. 
Switch the name/sex variable values that get assigned and explore the popularity
of different names.

```{r, message=FALSE}
baby_name <- "Jeffrey"
baby_sex <- "M"

single_name <- babynames %>% 
  filter(name==baby_name & sex==baby_sex)

ggplot(data=single_name, mapping = aes(x=year, y=prop)) + 
  geom_line() +
  xlim(c(1880, 2014)) +
  ylim(c(0, NA)) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab(paste("Prop. of ", baby_sex, " born with name ", baby_name, sep=""))
```
