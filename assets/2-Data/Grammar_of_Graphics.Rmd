## What is a statistical graphic?

Today we kick off Topic 2.b) **Data Visualization** by asking ourselves

What is a statistical graphic?

But a brief lesson from military history first:



## Napoleon's March on Russia in 1812

In 1812, Napoleon led a French invasion of Russia, marching on [Moscow](https://goo.gl/maps/geRyXH3rJcK2).

## Napoleon's March on Russia in 1812

It was one of the biggest [military
disasters](http://www.history.com/news/napoleons-disastrous-invasion-of-russia-200-years-ago)
ever, in particular b/c of the Russian winter.

## Minard's Illustration of the March

Famous graphical illustration of Napolean's march to/from Moscow

## Minard's Illustration of the March

This was considered a revolution in statistical graphics because between

* the map on top
* the line graph on the bottom

there are 6 dimensions of information (i.e. variables) being displayed on a 2D page.



## Minard's Illustration of the March

Where? | **`data`** | **`aes()`**  | **`geom_`**
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
top map | longitude | **`x`** | **`point`** 
" | latitude | **`y`** | **`point`** 
" | army size | **`size`** | **`path`**
" | army direction (forward vs retreat) | **`color`** | **`path`**
bottom graph | date | **`x, y`** | **`text`**
" | temperature | **`x, y`** | **`line`**



## Grammar of Graphics

Wilkinson (2005) laid out the proposed "Grammar of Graphics"

## Grammar of Graphics

Wickham implemented the grammar in R in `ggplot2` package

## Edward Tufte

Another seminal book (which isn't as high level) is Tufte's "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information"
