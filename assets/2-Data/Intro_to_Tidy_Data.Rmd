## What is Tidy Data?

There are many ways to organize data. Today we learn one way: the "tidy data" format. It is rather simple, but deceptively powerful.

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

The third point means we don't mix apples and oranges, keep apples together with apples.


## What is Tidy Data?

This slide added on Tue 10/4:

1. Each observation forms a row. In other words, each row corresponds to a single **observational unit**
1. Each variable forms a column:
    + Some of the variables may be used to identify the **observational units**. For organizational purposes, it's generally better to put these in the left-hand columns
    + Some of the variables may be **observed values** associated with each observational unit
1. Each type of observational unit forms a table.



## What is Tidy Data?

This is just a spreadsheet! 

But we are very strict about the previous three rules.



## nycflights13 Package

The [`nycflights13`](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13) package contains
information about all flights that departed from NYC (e.g. EWR, JFK and LGA) in
2013: 336,776 flights in total. To help understand what causes delays, it also
includes a number of other useful datasets:

* `weather`: hourly meterological data for each airport
* `planes`: construction information about each plane
* `airports`: airport names and locations
* `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier codes and names
