## nycflights13 Package

The [`nycflights13`](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13) package contains
information about all flights that departed from NYC (e.g. EWR, JFK and LGA) in
2013: 336,776 flights in total. To help understand what causes delays, it also
includes a number of other useful datasets:

* `weather`: hourly meterological data for each airport
* `planes`: construction information about each plane
* `airports`: airport names and locations
* `airlines`: translation between two letter carrier codes and names
