## Switching Gears

With the internet, we are in a new age of data:

## Bridging the Gap

> * Meet Jenny Bryan at UBC: <a target="_blank" class="page-link" href="https://github.com/jennybc">GitHub</a> profile
> * She teaches a graduate level class <a target="_blank" class="page-link" href="http://stat545.com/">STAT 545</a> on **Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R**. Note the ordering.

## Classroom vs Real Data

Jenny Bryan said: *"Classroom data are like teddy bears and real data are like a grizzly bear with salmon blood dripping out its mouth."*

Traditional Classroom Data            |  Real Data
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
<img src="../figure/teddy.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>  |  <img src="../figure/grizzly.gif" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>



## Real Data

Some attributes of real data:

> * Often not in a format ready for analysis
> * Messy and needs cleaning
> * Typos, weird outliers
> * Missing values
> * Inconsistent formatting



## Real Data

Inconsistent formatting is a real pain:

> * Dates: "2016/10/12" vs "2016-10-12" vs "10/12/16" vs "10/12/2016" vs "Oct 12, 2016"
> * "DC" vs "D.C." vs "District of Columbia"
> * "Beyonce" vs "Beyonc√©"



## dplyr Package

To take this, we now officially introduce the `dplyr` package: a grammar of data manipulation

</p>



## Pedogical Note

Were it not for this package, I probably wouldn't be taking a data-centric view to this course.   

**Why do I have a `dplyr` sticker on my laptop? Why is `dplyr` so good IMO?**

> * The **verb** describing the action you want to perform on your data **IS** the name of the `function()` you use.
> * So you don't need extensive programming experience (indexing, for loops, etc) to be able to manipulate data.




## 5MV

Say hello to the 5MV: the **five main verbs**

> 1. `select()` columns by variable name
> 1. `filter()` rows matching criteria
> 1. `mutate()` existing variables to create new ones
> 1. `arrange()` rows
> 1. `summarise()` numerical variables that are `group_by()` categorical variables
> 1. Also, later `_join()` two separate data frames `by` corresponding variables




## Today:

1. `select()` columns by variable name: front of cheatsheet, bottom right
1. `filter()` rows matching criteria: front of cheatsheet, bottom middle. We've already used this in Chapter 3 on Data Viz.

Keep looking back and forth between book and cheatsheet!

## Important Concept: Piping

Piping allows you to take the output of one function and **pipe** it as the input of
the next function. You can string along several pipes to form a single **chain**.

* R Command: `%>%`
* Described as: "_then_". 



## Important Concept: Piping

Ex:  say you want to apply functions `h()` and `g()` and then `f()` on data `x`.  You can do

* `f(g(h(x)))` OR
* `x %>% h() %>% g() %>% f()`

This

> * saves you from confusing nested parentheses
> * emphasizes the **sequential** breaking down of tasks, making it more readable
> * i.e. Do this _then_ do this _then_ do this _then_ ...




## Important Concept: Piping

Pipes are always directed to the first argument of any function. The following three bits of R code
do the same thing, extract all january flights:

```{r,eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(nycflights13)
data(flights)

# Bit 1: No piping
filter(flights, month == 1)

# Bit 2: Piping. Note no comma
flights %>% filter(month == 1)

# Bit 3: Piping across multiple lines (preferred for legibility)
flights %>% 
  filter(month==1)
```
