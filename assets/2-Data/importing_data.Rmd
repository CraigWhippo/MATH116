## Recall from the First Lecture

<!--
Hi professor, I really liked your intro stats class. Can I ask you a stats question on a bio project I'm working on?
I have gene expression data in this excel file. How would I run some of the methods we learned in class on it?

## How do I import my own data into R?

> * You're going to need to do this for your final project (details coming soon)
> * It's not rocket science/brain surgery, but it still takes practice.

## Working Directory

Often before we can import our own data into R, we need to set the **working
directory** i.e. the folder R is going to look for files in.

Say there is a spreadsheet file you want to load into R:

1. In the Files Panel of RStudio, navigate to the folder where the spreadsheet file is.
1. In the Files Panel click -> More -> Set As Working Directory



## How do I import my own data into R?

Say your data is in an Excel file called `example.xlsx`

1. Make sure your values are in **tidy data format**
1. Set the correct working directory
1. Then use the `read_excel()` function in the `readxl` package as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(readxl)
example <- read_excel("example.xlsx")
```

## How do I import my own data into R?

> * Excel `.xlsx` files aren't the best file format as they not only contain the data, 
but also lots of Microsoft metadata (data about the data) that we don't need.
> * Alternative: Comma-separated values `.csv` files are a **minimalist** format for 
spreadsheet data.



## What is a CSV file?

* A `.csv` file [(example)](http://www.sqlshack.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/word-image35.png) is just data and no fluff:
    + Rows are separated by line breaks.
    + Values for a given row (i.e. variables) are separated by commas. Each row has equal number of commas.
    + The first row is typically a header row with the column/variable names

Note `.csv` files are in tidy data format.



## Convert to `.xlsx` to `.csv`

You can convert `.xlsx` files to `.csv` format from Excel (and Google Docs):

* Go to File -> Save As... -> File Format -> Windows Comma Separated (.csv)
* Add `.csv` to the filename
* Click "Save As"



## Today's Exercise: Load a CSV into R

Today you will load the `DD_vs_SB.csv` file that contains the Dunkin Donuts and
Starbucks data from Question 2 from Midterm II so that you can use it for Problem
Set 07.




## Today's Exercise: Load CSV into RStudio

1. From the Problem Sets page, upload both `PS-07.Rmd` and `DD_vs_SB.csv` to your Problem Set folder on RStudio server.
1. In the RStudio Environment Panel -> "Import Dataset" -> From Local File... -> Select `DD_vs_SB.csv` -> Open
1. Make sure "Heading" is set to "Yes". This tells RStudio that the first row are the variable names.
1. Click Import
1. The `View()` panel should pop up with the data. Make sure the variable names are correct.



## Today's Exercise: Load CSV into RStudio

Now look at your console. You should see a line that looks something like:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
DD_vs_SB <- read.csv("~/Problem_Sets/DD_vs_SB.csv")
```

This is the line of code that loads the CSV file into R and assigns it to an object
called `DD_vs_SB`, which you will be working with. 

1. Copy your version of the above line of code into the code block for Question 2 of `PS-07.Rmd`
1. Knit the file to test that it works
1. If so, start `PS-07.Rmd`!
