## Recall

* Say its the early 1900's, and you are a statistician and you meet someone who claims to be able to tell by tasting whether the tea or the milk was added first to a cup.
* You call BS and think they are just guessing.
* Say you have 8 cups, tea, and milk handy. How would you **design an experiment** to test whether a) they can really tell which came first or b) they are just guessing?
* Brainstorm all the components of this experiment with your seatmates, ~~then think about how you can implement this with `resampl()`ing~~.

Let's pick some pods at random...



## Randomness

We'll view randomness in stats largely through two lenses. Either:

1. **Random sampling**: Obtaining a representative sample from a population. Ex: The tub of rice. 
1. **Random assignment**: Used in the design of experiements. Last and today's lecture.




## Explanatory and Response Variables

A medical doctor pours over some his patients' medical records and observes:

People who do this:            |  Wake up with this:
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
<img src="../figure/shoes.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>  |  <img src="../figure/headache.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>



## Explanatory and Response Variables

He then posits the following **causal** relationship:

* Explanatory AKA treatment variable: sleeping with shoes on 
* Response variable: waking up with headaches

What's wrong?

## Mantra of Statistics

**Correlation is not necessarily causation**:

> * [Spurious correlations](http://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)
> * [Organic food causes autism!](http://io9.gizmodo.com/on-correlation-causation-and-the-real-cause-of-auti-1494972271)
> * Does college cause higher earnings?



## Two Types of Studies

To study the effect of a treatment there are two types of studies

* **Observational studies**: Researchers have no control over who receives the treatment
* **Randomized experiments**: Researchers not only have control over who receives the treatment, but also make the assignments at random

The latter is the **gold standard** for making causal statements.




## ECON 212

Making causal statements with observational studies is harder because
you need to **control for** (account for) all possible confounding variables; but you may not know them
all

Prof. Caitlin Myers' "Empirical Economic Research" this Spring will study
methods that attempt to make **causal statements** despite only having
observational data. This class satisfies the prereq.




## Back to Example

* Sleeping with shoes on does not **cause** headaches, but rather is
**associated/correlated** with headaches.
* The treatment (sleeping with shoes on) was NOT assigned at random, so we can't
make a statement on shoes causing headaches.
* We need a **randomized experiment**!




## Principles of Designing Experiements

* Controlling:  We want to control for differences between the two groups.
* Randomization: We randomize individuals into treatment vs control so that any differences in variables that are not of interest even out in the long run.  
* Replication:  The more cases we observe, the more "precise" the results.
* Blocking:  Researchers sometimes know or suspect that variables, other than the treatment, influence the response. In this case, they may first group individuals based on this variable into blocks and then randomize cases within each block.  
* Blindedness: When researchers do not inform patients which group, or arm, they are in
* Double blinded study:  When the person administering the treatment/control themselves do not know which group the patient is in.
* Placebo: Fake treatment.  Sometimes the thought alone of having a treatment is enough to influence behavior/results.  



## Today's Learning Checks

I went to grad school in Seattle, where Garfield High School is located. Famous
alums include:

* Quincy Jones: Producer and composer
* Jimi Hendrix: Guitarist
* Brandon Roy: Former NBA Rookie of the Year
* Macklemore: Rapper
* Minoru Yamasaki: World Trade Center architect



## Today's Learning Checks

Next door is Ezell's Fried Chicken:

## Today's Learning Checks

One day I was raving about Ezell's Chicken.  My friend Nick accused me "buying into the hype";

So what did we do?



## Today's Learning Checks

Fried Chicken Face Off:

Do people prefer this?            |  Or this?

## Design an Experiment

Say you have 12 grad students eager to procrastinate, how would you design a
taste test to ascertain: independent of hype, which chicken is better?

Use the principles from above.
