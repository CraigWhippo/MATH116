## Course Title

> * In catalog: Introduction to Statistical Sciences
> * New: Introduction to Statistical **and Data** Sciences



## What is Data Science?

## Dialogue with Student

<!--
Hi professor, I really liked your intro stats class. Can I ask you a stats question on a bio project I'm working on?
I have gene expression data in this excel file. How would I run some of the methods we learned in class on it?

## Course Objective #1

Have students engage in the data/science research pipeline in as faithful a
manner as possible while maintaining a level [suitable for
novices](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05346).  

> * Cobb: Minimizing prerequisites to research
> * Not necessarily publishing in top journals, but **answering scientific questions with data**.


## Data/Science Research Pipeline

We will, as best we can, perform all this:

## Course Objective #2

Foster a conceptual understanding of statistical topics and methods using 
[simulation/resampling](https://www.amstat.org/education/pdfs/ResamplingUndergradCurriculum.pdf)
and real data whenever possible, rather than mathematical formulae.

> * Real data: "Classroom data are like teddy bears and real data are like a grizzly bear with salmon blood dripping out its mouth."
> * There are two "engines" that can make statistics "work"
>     + Mathematics: formulas, approximations, etc
>     + Computers: simulations, random number generation 





## The "Engine" of Statistics

In this course, computers and not math will be the "engine". What does this mean?

> * Less of this:

> * But more of this:  
> <img src="../figure/coding.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/> 



## Programming/Coding

> * This course is **NOT** a course on programming, coding, nor computer science.
> * You will however be exposed to basic **computational and algorithmic** thinking.
> * Hadley Wickham's [Words of Wisdom](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/589068687669243905?lang=en)
> * Coding as building, crafting, construction, but in the virtual sense
>     + Before you can build one of [these](https://www.etsy.com/listing/208279151/rustic-wooden-spice-rack-ledge-shelf?ref=market)
>     + You'll need to build a few of [these](http://i255.photobucket.com/albums/hh143/werdnayarg/webstuf/Homer%20Spice%20Rack/Homer_Simpson_Spice.jpg)



## Course Objective #3

Blur the traditional lecture/lab dichotomy of introductory statistics courses 
by incorporating more [computational and algorithmic
thinking](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~statcur/Preprints/ComputingCurric3.pdf) 
into the syllabus.

> * Completely separate lecture and labs is a legacy of a time before  
> <img src="../figure/laptop.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/> 



<!--
## Course Objective #4

Introduce best practices for reproducible research and collaboration. 

**Why**: Whenever possible both 

* data
* code

should be open and accountable for the world to see, share, and critique. 




## Course Objective #5

Develop [statistical 
literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_literacy) by, among other
ways, tying in the curriculum to current events, demonstrating the importance
statistics plays in society.

> * H.G. Wells (paraphrased): "Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write."
> * Me: "Sure, it's easy to lie with statistics. But it's also hard to tell the truth without them."
