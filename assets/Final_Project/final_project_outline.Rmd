## Learning Goals

**Only one**: The first course objective in the syllabus: *Have students engage in the
data/science research pipeline in as faithful a manner as possible while
maintaining a level suitable for novices*:

#### Format

* Your final project will center around writing a "data journalism" style 
newspaper article suitable for publication in <a href =
"https://middleburycampus.com/" target = "_blank">The Middlebury Campus
newspaper</a>. In other words, your target audience is the Middlebury community.
Examples of such types of journalism can be found on:
    + <a href = "http://fivethirtyeight.com/" target = "_blank">FiveThirtyEight</a>
    + The New York Times' <a href = "http://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot" target = "_blank">The Upshot</a>
* You must flex your "statistical and data sciences" muscles you've
built this semester. In particular:
    + Data visualization and manipulation
    + Statistical Inference: hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression (coming up)





## Administrative Notes

* **Submission Format**: Each group must create a single RStudio Server shared 
project that is shared amongst the group members and with me (please email the
URL to me). All your work will be centrally located here; do not email me any
files.
* **Project Proposal**: Submitted latest by Monday Nov 21 11am
    + In class: Printed copy of project proposal
    + In the RStudio Server group shared folder:
        + Electronic copy of project proposal
        + All data files and if possible a `.R` script that loads them into R so that you can `View()` them.
* **Feedback Session**: Held latest by Friday Dec 2nd
    + To make sure your project idea is feasible, after you've submitted your
    proposal and I've read it, your group must schedule to speak to me during
    office hours so that I can give feedback. While this must be done by Friday
    Dec 2nd, please note the earlier you complete this, the more breathing room
    this will give you.
* **Electronic-Only Final Project Submission**: Due Sunday Dec 18 Noon
    + In the RStudio Server group shared folder:
        + A `final_project.Rmd` file that completely reproduces your analysis i.e. I should have to press Knit only once to recreate the entire HTML page.
        + All necessary data files.
    + Individually: A Google Forms survey, which I will email on Fri Dec 16 by 5pm.
    + Your project won't be considered submitted until I give you email confirmation that everything looks good.
* **Office Hours**: During exam week
    + ~~Tuesday Dec 13: 9-12 and 1-4~~
    + ~~Wednesday Dec 15: 9-12 and 1-4~~
    + ~~Friday Dec 16: 9-12~~
    + ~~I might be out of town that weekend, so email responses might be slow.~~
    + Saturday Dec 10: 10-4pm in Warner 310
    + Wednesday Dec 14: 10-4pm (by request on Google Hangouts or FaceTime)
    + Saturday Dec 17: 12-4pm in Warner 310
* **Honor Code**: This is the equivalent of an academic term paper; all honor code rules about plagarism and citations apply.





## Project Proposal

#### Write-Up

Your group proposal (to be submitted in print and electronically in a RStudio
Server shared project) should contain the following:

1. **Title**: The title of your project.
1. **Group Members**: List of all group members.
1. **Purpose**: Describe the general topic/phenomenon you want to explore:
    + Why should a Middlebury student be interested in your work? 
    + What do you hope people will learn from your project?
1. **Scientific Question**: Journalism, just like academic writing, has the goal
of answering questions, but with a slightly more informal tone. What is the 
scientific question you want to answer using data?
1. **Data Sources**: Describe where you will find/access your
data. Be as specific as you can, listing URLs and file formats if possible.
1. **Data Format**: As described in the Tips section of the Problem Set 06
<a href = "https://rudeboybert.github.io/MATH116/assets/LC/PS/PS-06_discussion.html" target = "_blank">discussion</a>, describe what your
tidy format data set looks like:
    * How many tables will you have? What are the observational units of each table?
    * How many rows does each table have?
    * How many columns does each table have and what are their names i.e. the
    variables? What are their units?


#### Data Sets

* Your **immediate goal** should be to get some data loaded into RStudio. This 
may take a few rounds of back-and-forth discussion with me as finding the right
data sets will be among the bigger challenges of this project, as it needs to
balance:
    + Being complex enough to use the statistical and data sciences toolbox developed this semester.
    + Being rich enough to be able to answer meaningful scientific questions with them.
    + Not being so complex and rich that you are overwhelmed, as you are only novices.
* Having two or more different data sets to join is not an explicit requirement
for this project; your scientific question will dictate this need.
* If you're having trouble finding specific data that you have in mind, make an
appointment with the Middlebury Data Services Librarian Ryan Clement.





## Electronic-Only Final Project Submission

Roughly speaking, your final project submission will have two major components:

* The actual journalism article. As to knowing the guidelines (length, format,
tone), just ask yourself: "What does a newspaper/online news story sound like?"
* A supplementary materials section that goes more in depth about the
nitty-gritty details, that one might want to spare casual readers from, but
include for people wanting to learn more.
* I will post the template `final_project.Rmd` file in the Problem Sets section
of the course webpage by Monday Nov 14th.
