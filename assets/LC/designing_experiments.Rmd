## Fried Chicken Face-Off

#### Design principles we put in place:

* **Single (but not double) blinded**: The taster doesn't know which (Ezell's or KFC) chicken they are eating, but the server does.
* **Randomizing**:
    + Which order of chicken you eat:  KFC first or not
    + Which kind of meat (wing, breast, leg) between tasters.  Each taster would try two kinds of meat. 
* **Controlling for**:
    + Which kind of meat within a taster. Ex: if you eat a KFC wing, you will necessarily eat an Ezell's wing
    + Temperature: We picked a place that is central to both Ezell's and KFC, given the cooling down of the chicken that can occur during travel.
    + Kind of batter: Wwe can't do KFC crispy chicken b/c Ezell's doesn't have that type of batter. This is a limitation of the study b/c some feel the crispy chicken is better.
    + Visual look: We thought blind-folds were a bit excessive
* **Replicates**: Just one replicate of each kind of meat due to finite budget and finite stomach space.


#### Results:

**Final score:  KFC 8, Ezell's 4**. Some notes:

* Even though people were "blinded", most knew which of the two pieces was from KFC.
* People generally felt
    + The meat from Ezell's was better, and this was magnified as the chicken went cold.
    + The skin was better at KFC.  Given that fried chicken is what it is b/c of the skin, people voted for KFC.
* Future studies should
    + Consider the chicken and the skin separately.
    + Have "overall experience" scores.
    + **Blocked** users into two groups first: those who've had Ezell's before and those who didn't.
* This can be viewed as an example of a **pilot study** used to inform how to design a study appropriately.
