## Fried Chicken Face-Off

#### Design principles we put in place:

* **Single blinded**: The taster doesn't know which (Ezell's or KFC) chicken they are eating, but the server does.
* **Randomizing**
    + Which order of chicken you eat:  KFC first or not
    + Which kind of meat (wing, breast, leg) between tasters.  Each taster would try two kinds of meat. 
* **Controlling** for
    + Which kind of meat within a taster:  i.e. if you eat a KFC wing, you will necessarily eat an Ezell's wing
    + Temperature: hence we're picking a place that is central to both Ezell's and KFC given the traveling required.
    + Kind of batter:  we can't do KFC crispy chicken b/c Ezell's doesn't have that type of batter. This is a limitation of the study b/c some feel the crispy chicken is better, but we have no choice.
    + Visual look: We thought blind-folds were a bit excessive
* **Replicates**: Just one replicate of each kind of meat due to finite budget and finite stomach space.


#### Results:

Final score:  KFC 8, Ezell's 4.

Some notes:

* Even though people were ``blinded'', most knew which the two pieces were from KFC.  
* People generally felt the chicken meat from Ezell's was better, and this was magnified as the chicken went cold.
* However, they felt the skin was better at KFC.  Given that fried chicken is what it is b/c of the skin, people voted for KFC.
* Future metrics need to consider the chicken and the skin separately, as well as the ``overall experience'' scores.  i.e. this face off should be viewed as a pilot study
