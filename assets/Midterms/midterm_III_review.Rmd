## Format

* Wed Nov 16, 7:30pm-10:00pm in Warner 506/507.
* I'm going to try to target it so the median completion time is about 1h15m
* Closed book, no calculators, but you may bring `dplyr` cheatsheet.
* You won't need to write 100% correct R code, but rather rough **pseudocode**




## Sources

* Lectures 01 through 23 inclusive
    + Read the slides from each lecture to get the **executive summary**
    + Learning check discussions
* Problem Sets!
