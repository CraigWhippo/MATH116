While I encourage you to discuss problem sets with your peers, you must submit your
own answers and not simple rewordings of another's work. Furthermore, **all
collaborations must be explicitly acknowledged at the top of your submissions**.

### Problem Set 03

* **Info:**
    + Assigned Sat 2/25
    + Due: Fri 3/3 11:15am
* **Homework:** 
    1. Complete this <a target="_blank" class="page-link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYv6TUIKFh9JymvwYGDwzWzsxioUjwSPc9jE34yo7lBbAujQ/viewform">feedback survey</a> on the "Intro to R" and "Intermediate R" courses on DataCamp.
    1. Complete the work in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/PS/PS-03.R" target="_blank">`PS-03.R`</a>, saving your work in this file as you will be submitting it. Standby for the submission format.
    1. Complete Chapter 2: Tidy Data of <a target="_blank" class="page-link" href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/effective-data-storytelling-using-the-tidyverse">Effective Data Storytelling using the tidyverse</a>
* **Learning Goals:**
    + Weaning yourselves away from the DataCamp nest and doing your own work in RStudio.
    + Baby's first data analysis!
* **Tips**:
    * *Learning to Code*:
        1. Computers are stupid: In order for step C of your code to work, you 
        need to make sure you ran steps A & B first.
        1. Learning strategy: Tweak existing code in the Learning Checks (go 
        over them!) to suit your ends; don't code from scratch.
    * *Working with Data*:
        1. Always look and explore your data first. In our case with the
        `View()` function and/or the `glimpse()` function from the `dplyr`
        package.
        1. Help files are your friend. Most R functions and datasets have
        help files. For example, you can access the help file for the `movies` 
        data set by typing `?movies`.
