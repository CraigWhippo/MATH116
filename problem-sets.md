While I encourage you to discuss problem sets with your peers, you must submit your
own answers and not simple rewordings of another's work. Furthermore, **all
collaborations must be explicitly acknowledged at the top of your submissions**.

## Problem Set I

* Assigned Fri 9/16
* Due Fri 9/23

#### Learning Goals

* This week's problem set doesn't involve much content, but rather is about
familiarizing yourselves with the problem set format and workflow using R
Markdown.
* You'll start
    + seeing what I mean by "computers are stupid"
    + develop the skill of "debugging": identifying and removing errors from code. In our case,
    if your R Markdown file won't load/compile/render, follow the steps in [R Markdown Debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7IyZ4On9OlrCOhygFxjC7XhQqyw8OludwChz-uFd_o/edit?usp=sharing).
    This usually solves about 85% of problems. If you're still stuck after this, speak to your peers or me.  
* In my experience, there are always a few hiccups with R Markdown, but by the
third assignmnt everything is clear.
