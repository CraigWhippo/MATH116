While I encourage you to discuss problem sets with your peers, you must submit your
own answers and not simple rewordings of another's work. Furthermore, **all
collaborations must be explicitly acknowledged at the top of your submissions**.

## Problem Set I

* Assigned Fri 9/16
* Due Fri 9/23

#### Learning Goals

* This week's problem set doesn't involve much content, but rather is about
familiarizing yourselves with the problem set workflow and submission format using R
Markdown.
* In particular, we'll go over how to share your analyses over the web with a couple of clicks of the mouse!
* You'll start
    + seeing what I mean by "computers are stupid"
    + develop the skill of "debugging": identifying and removing errors from
    code. In our case, if your R Markdown file won't knit AKA load AKA compile 
    AKA render, follow the steps in [R Markdown 
    debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7IyZ4On9OlrCOhygFxjC7XhQqyw8OludwChz-uFd_o/edit?usp=sharing)
    (also posted on the Resources page). This usually solves about 85% of
    problems; if you're still stuck after going through the steps, speak to your
    peers or me.
* In my experience, there are always a few hiccups with R Markdown at the
beginning, but by the third assignment everyone is on board.


#### Homework

* Download this file to your computer, then upload it to the RStudio Server as described in Lec03: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/PS/PS-01.Rmd" target="_blank">`PS-01.Rmd`</a>
* Submit your homework using this [submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1n1HNo17MA21-DQ_boklchwCjfr6_qx7GrLY5ot7796g/edit)
