# Lec01 - Mon 2/13: Introduction

## Course Title

* In catalog: Introduction to Statistical Sciences
* New: Introduction to Statistical **and Data** Sciences



## What is Data Science?  {.flexbox .vcenter}

## Data Science

* Example domains: biology, economics, physics, sociology, etc.
* So why the title switch?


## Dialogue with Student 

<!--
Hi professor, I really liked your intro stats class. Can I ask you a stats question on a bio project I'm working on?
I have gene expression data in this excel file. How would I run some of the methods we learned in class on it?

## Course Objective #1

Have students engage in the data/science research pipeline in as faithful a
manner as possible while maintaining a level [suitable for
novices](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05346).  

* Cobb: Minimizing prerequisites to research
* Not necessarily publishing in top journals, but **answering scientific questions with data**.
* Difficult to do research without understanding stats, however


## Data/Science Research Pipeline

We will, as best we can, perform all this:

## Data/Science Research Pipeline

And not just this, as in many previous intro stats courses:

## Course Objective #2

Foster a conceptual understanding of statistical topics and methods using 
[simulation/resampling](https://www.amstat.org/education/pdfs/ResamplingUndergradCurriculum.pdf)
and real data whenever possible, rather than mathematical formulae.

* Whenever we can, use real data
* "Classroom data are like teddy bears and real data are like a grizzly bear with salmon blood dripping out its mouth."
* Example data set: [nycflights](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13)
* There are two "engines" that can make statistics "work"
    + Mathematics: formulas, approximations, etc
    + Computers: simulations, random number generation 





## The "Engine" of Statistics

In this course, computers and not math will be the "engine". What does this mean?

* Less of this:  
<img src="./assets/figure/formulas.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>
* But more of this:  
<img src="./assets/figure/coding.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>



## Programming/Coding

* Previous programming/coding experience **is not a prerequisite to this course**
* This course is **NOT** a course on programming, coding, nor computer science
* You will however be exposed to basic **computational and algorithmic** thinking





## Course Objective #3

Blur the traditional lecture/lab dichotomy of introductory statistics courses 
by incorporating more [computational and algorithmic
thinking](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~statcur/Preprints/ComputingCurric3.pdf) 
into the syllabus.

* Completely separate lecture and labs is a legacy of a time before  
<img src="./assets/figure/laptop.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>





## RStudio Server

* Not all laptops are created equal: operating system, processing power, age
* RStudio Server: cloud-based version of RStudio where all processing is done on Middlebury servers
* [`go/rstudio/`](https://rstudio.middlebury.edu/) (on campus or via VPN)




## Thursday Lab Time

**Undirected** time to

* Set aside to help people get up to speed with computing
* It is like learning a language.
* Learn from each other.
* Collaborate on problem sets (due on Fridays)


## Course Objective #5

Develop [statistical 
literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_literacy) by, among other
ways, tying in the curriculum to current events, demonstrating the importance
statistics plays in society.

* H.G. Wells (paraphrased): "Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write."
* Me: "Sure, it's easy to lie with statistics. But it's also hard to tell the truth without them."




## Data Visualization and EDA

* EDA = Exploratory data analysis
* **"Data visualization is a gateway drug to statistics."**
* Prez from Season 4 of "The Wire":

## Final Project

* ~~Final exam~~
* Capstone experience to align this topics and principles of this course with how research and learning is done in practice.
* Work on interpersonal and collaborative skills. No textbook on that!



## What is R vs RStudio?
