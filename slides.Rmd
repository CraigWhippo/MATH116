# Lec01 - Mon 2/13: Introduction

## Course Title

* In catalog: Introduction to Statistical Sciences
* New: Introduction to Statistical **and Data** Sciences



## What is Data Science?  {.flexbox .vcenter}

![](./assets/figure/data_science_1.png)



## Data Science

* Example domains: biology, economics, physics, sociology, etc.
* So why the title switch?



## Dialogue with Student 

<!--
Hi professor, I really liked your intro stats class. Can I ask you a stats question on a bio project I'm working on?
I have gene expression data in this excel file. How would I run some of the methods we learned in class on it?

## Course Objective #1

Have students engage in the data/science research pipeline in as faithful a
manner as possible while maintaining a level [suitable for
novices](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05346).  

* Cobb: Minimizing prerequisites to research
* Not necessarily publishing in top journals, but **answering scientific questions with data**.
* Difficult to do research without understanding stats, however



## Data/Science Research Pipeline

We will, as best we can, perform all this:

![](./assets/figure/pipeline.png)



## Data/Science Research Pipeline

And not just this, as in many previous intro stats courses:

![](./assets/figure/pipeline2.png)



## Course Objective #2

Foster a conceptual understanding of statistical topics and methods using 
[simulation/resampling](https://www.amstat.org/education/pdfs/ResamplingUndergradCurriculum.pdf)
and real data whenever possible, rather than mathematical formulae.

* Whenever we can, use real data
* Example data set: [nycflights13](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13)
* There are two "engines" that can make statistics "work"
    + Mathematics: formulas, approximations, etc
    + Computers: simulations, random number generation 



## The "Engine" of Statistics

In this course, computers and not math will be the "engine". What does this mean?

* Less of this:  
<img src="./assets/figure/formulas.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>
* But more of this:  
<img src="./assets/figure/coding.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>



## Programming/Coding

* Previous programming/coding experience **is not a prerequisite to this course**
* This course is not an explicit course on programming, coding, nor computer science. But we will use some elements. 
* Also you will be exposed to basic **algorithmic thinking and computational logic**
* Learning R is like learning a foreign language: its really hard at first!



## Two Simple Rules of Learning Code

* Computers are stupid!
* When learning, take existing code that works, and tweak it!



## Course Objective #3

Blur the traditional lecture/lab dichotomy of introductory statistics courses 
by incorporating more [computational and algorithmic
thinking](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~statcur/Preprints/ComputingCurric3.pdf) 
into the syllabus.

* Completely separate lecture and labs is a legacy of a time before  
<img src="./assets/figure/laptop.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>



## RStudio Server

* Not all laptops are created equal: operating system, processing power, age
* RStudio Server: cloud-based version of RStudio where all processing is done on Middlebury servers
* [`go/rstudio/`](https://rstudio.middlebury.edu/) (on campus or via VPN)



<!--
## Thursday Lab Time

**Undirected** time to

* Set aside to help people get up to speed with computing
* It is like learning a language.
* Learn from each other.
* Collaborate on problem sets (due on Fridays)
-->



## Course Objective #5

Develop [statistical 
literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_literacy) by, among other
ways, tying in the curriculum to current events, demonstrating the importance
statistics plays in society.

* H.G. Wells (paraphrased): "Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write."
* Me: "Sure, it's easy to lie with statistics. But it's also hard to tell the truth without them."



<!--
## Data Visualization and EDA

* EDA = Exploratory data analysis
* **"Data visualization is a gateway drug to statistics."**
* Prez from Season 4 of HBO's "The Wire":
* <center><img src="./assets/figure/Prez.png" height="300px"/></center>
-->



## Final Project

* Capstone experience to align this topics and principles of this course with how research and learning is done in practice.
* Work on interpersonal and collaborative skills. No textbook on that!



## Lecture Format

Either

* **Lab format**: With laptop
    + You sit in groups of 4
    + I'll talk for 10-15 minutes before you work on learning checks
* **Chalk talk**: Old-school
    + Keep desk in rows
    + More traditional lecture format



## Let's Build our Toolbox

## R, RStudio, and DataCamp

* R: Software behind the scenes i.e. **the engine**
* RStudio: Intergrated development environment i.e. **the interface**
* DataCamp: Browser-based learning tool i.e. **the driver's ed teacher**



## Analogy

R            |  RStudio |  DataCamp
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
<img src="./assets/figure/engine.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;"/>  |  <img src="./assets/figure/dashboard.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;"/>  |  <img src="./assets/figure/instructor.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;"/>



## Test Drive RStudio

> * Login to [`go/rstudio/`](https://rstudio.middlebury.edu/auth-sign-in) with your Midd account
> * If you don't have access, raise your hand. (Username: guest1, password: rstudioguest)
> * In RStudio menu bar -> File -> New File -> R Script



## The Four Panels

1. Console: Crunch numbers in R
1. Files, Packages, Help: See your files, install packages, help files
1. Editor: Where you'll write code and save it
1. Environment: Your workspace



## Important: Console

> * This is where you run/execute commands
> * The ">" is the prompt.  It means R is ready to receive commands
> * If you donâ€™t see a ">" and want to restart, press ESC.



## Switching Gears

Now we will use R via DataCamp instead of via RStudio, but just for driver's ed. Two panels exist in both:

1. Editor panel: Where you write code
1. Console panel: Where you will execute code
