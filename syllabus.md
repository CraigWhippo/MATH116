## MATH 116: Fall 2016

* **Instructor:** [Albert Y. Kim](http://community.middlebury.edu/~aykim/) - Assistant Professor of Statistics
* **Email:** [aykim@middlebury.edu](aykim@middlebury.edu)
    + I will respond to emails within 24h, but not during weekends.
    + Please only email me with administrative and briefer questions as I prefer addressing more substantive questions in person.
* **Class Location/Time:**
    + MWF 11:15â€“12:05 in Warner 506 and R 11:00-12:15 in Sunderland 202.
    + You do not need to inform me of absenses. Please consult your peers for what you missed.
* **Office Hours:** Warner 310 or the math lounge just outside. Feel free to come to the [MATH 216]({{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/teaching/courses/MATH216/2016-09.html) office hours as well, but those students get priority then. 
    + M 2:30-4:00 and W 1:00-2:30
    + MATH 216: M 1:00-2:30 and W 2:30-4:00
    + Or by appointment





## Course Description and Objectives

This is an introductory probability and statistics class where a conceptual understanding of the material will be stressed.  Goals of this course include:

* Expose students to statistical concepts, including sampling, data visualizations, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and regression.
* Give students experience manipulating and analyzing data using the R statistical software package.
* Introduce the theory underlying statistics, including probability, distributions, the central limit theorem, etc.
* Develop statistical literacy.
* Tie in the curriculum to current events, demonstrating the importance statistics plays in society.





## Topics

Roughtly speaking, the course will cover the following topics (for a more
precise breakdown of topics, click
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qy21hHMbjYfv65IL5DwxID0nEltXgOD6h52hBVwWa_s/edit#gid=0)):

1. Tools: R, RStudio, and R Markdown
1. Data:
    * Data formatting
    * Data visualization
    * Data manipulation/wrangling/munging
1. Statistical inference:
    * Background and terminology
    * Confidence intervals
    * Hypothesis testing
1. Regression:
    * Simple linear regression
    * Multiple regression
    * Logistic regression (time allowing)





## Materials

#### 1) Textbooks

* Intro Stat with Randomization and Simulation 1st edition by Diez, Barr, and Cetinkaya-Rundel.  This
textbook is available
    + Online at the [OpenIntro
    webpage](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=isrs) in both
    standard  and tablet friendly PDF formats
    + In print at the Middlebury bookstore and 
    [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Introductory-Statistics-Randomization-Simulation-David/dp/1500576697)


#### 2) Computing and Software

* Instead of using a desktop version of the RStudio integrated development 
environment (IDE) for R, we will be using the cloud-based RStudio Server 
interface, which you can access via 
[`go/rstudio`](https://rstudio.middlebury.edu/). Note if you are off-campus you 
must first log into the [Middlebury 
VPN](http://mediawiki.middlebury.edu/wiki/LIS/Off-campus_Access).





## Evaluation

There are four components to your final grade: problem sets, engagement,
midterms, and the final project.


#### 1) Problem Sets 10%

Each problem is worth only a nominal portion of the final grade. As such, 
instead of viewing them as evaluative tools used by the instructor to assign 
grades, they should be viewed as low-stakes opportunities to develop one's
statistics and data science toolboxes and receive feedback on the progress of
one's learning.

While I encourage you to discuss homeworks with your peers, you must submit your
own answers and not simple rewordings of another's work.  Furthermore, all
collaborations must be explicitly acknowledged on your submissions.

* No email submissions will be accepted; ask a classmate to print it for you.
* Homeworks are due at the beginning of lecture/lab.
* Unstapled homeworks and homeworks without names/section numbers will be penalized 25%.
* Late (defined as after lecture ending) submissions will be accepted up to 2 days after the due date at a 25% penalty per day. If you submit late, your graded homeworks might be returned late as well.
* You need to show all work to receive full credit.

#### 2) Engagement 10%

It is difficult to explicity codify what constitutes "an engaged student", so 
instead I present the following rough principle I will follow: **you'll only get
out of this class as much as you put in**. Some examples of behavior counter to this
principle:

* Merely attending lectures and not participating in discussions.
* Leveraging previous experience in other settings to coast through this course.
* Not coming to office hours when the situation warrants it. 
* Submitting homework that has code or content that is copied from (or only
slightly modified versions of) your peers' work, going against the philosophy of
the homeworks being opportunities for practice and feedback, rather than as items 
to be graded on.

#### 3) Midterms

* Midterms:
* All midterms are cummulative and require a scientific calculator (smartphones are not allowed).
* No extra-credit work to improve midterm scores after the fact.
* There will be no make-up nor rescheduled midterm, except in the following cases:
    + serious illness or death in the family only if documentation is provided.
    + athletic commitments or religious obligations only if documentation is
    provided and prior notice is given. In such cases, rescheduled exams must be
    taken **before** the rest of the class.

#### 4) Final Project

* Group project in groups of three where I will be assigning groups.
    




## Academic Accommodations for Disabilities

Students with documented disabilities who believe that they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact me as early in the semester as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. Assistance is available to eligible students through Student Accessibility Services. Please contact Jodi Litchfield, the ADA coordinator, at [litchfie@middlebury.edu](litchfie@middlebury.edu) or 802.443.5936 for more information. All discussions will remain confidential.
